# Creating Activities

Steps to follow:
- Make sure you are creating your Markdown file in the docs folder.
- The name of your markdown file should be what you want it to be displayed as on the index page.
- All images being used in your markdown file should be placed in the `pages/static/images` folder.
- You can use relative path to the images. for eg. `./static/images/example.png`.
